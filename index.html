                    <P><mark>We are all consumers. Yes, even when we were in our motherâ€™s womb we have been part taking of what
                        our mothers consumed! In economic sense, consumers generally have to buy something to be able to
                        use goods and services. In doing so we must be able to exercise our rights and be a responsible
                        consumer as well.</mark></P>
